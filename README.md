# Deep3D-Tensorflow
This project aims to reproduce Deep3D method using tensorflow.

[Deep3D](https://github.com/piiswrong/deep3d) is an awesome algorithm of the right view synthesis from a single left view. The original design was done by MXNet. In this project, I use tensorflow to reproduce Deep3D algorithm to generalize the usage.
